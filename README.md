# SKFCM_MatLab
A MatLab implementation of SKFCM algorithm. 

This project is developed by Yangyang Wang in 12/12/2017.


HOW TO RUN: create an 'output' folder under root path, put all test images under 'files/whole/' foler, run 'main.m', the program will loop through all images under 'files/whole/' foler and output results to 'output' folder.


SKFCM is proposed by Dao-QiangZhang and Song-CanChen in their paper: A novel kernelized fuzzy C-means algorithm with application in medical image segmentation
